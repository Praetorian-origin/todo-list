// features :

// view all projects
// view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
// expand a single todo to see/edit its details
// delete a todo


// You should separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.
